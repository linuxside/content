meta_description: Learn how to partition and format any external USB drive (memory stick, HDD, SSD) to the FAT32 filesystem on Linux using command line fdisk and the mkfs fat32 command. This will allow you to seamlessly transfer files between different operating systems, making it easy to share files across multiple devices.

Partitioning and formatting a **USB memory stick** to a **FAT32 filesystem** is a useful process that allows for easy transfer of files between devices with different operating systems.

In this guide, we will be using **Debian** as the operating system for partitioning and formatting the USB memory stick to FAT32. However, the commands we will be using are not specific to Debian and will work on any **Debian-derived OS** such as Ubuntu, Raspbian OS and Linux Mint.

Before we proceed, I cannot emphasize enough **the importance of backing up your drive before running ANY command** below.

As a side note, the commands I will be using require **root** user access or a **sudo-enabled** user.

## 1. Install the dependencies

The `dosfstools` package includes the `mkfs.fat`, `fatlabel` and `fsck.fat` utilities.  
The *mkfs.fat* utility is used to **create** the MS-DOS FAT32 file system, *fatlabel* utility sets or gets a MS-DOS **filesystem label** from a given device, while the *fsck.fat* utility **checks and repairs** the MS-DOS FAT32 file system.

If these tools are not installed, you can install them by typing:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install dosfstools
```

## 2. Find out which drive is the USB drive

```bash
sudo parted -l
```

this will list all the available drives. In my case, the device was `/dev/sdb`.

**Warning!** Ensure that you have selected the correct device, otherwise you may lose all your data!

## 3. Partition the drive

Because my drive had already a few partitions, I will delete all of them and create a single FAT32 partition.

```bash
sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
```

a. type **d** (delete partition) as many times as there are partitions  
b. type **n** (new partition) and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> 4 times (the first enter for *partition type* as *primary*, the second enter for the *partition number* as *1*, the third enter for the *first sector* as *default value* and the last enter for the *last sector* as *default value*)  
c. type **w** (write changes)  
d. type **q** (quit fdisk, if it didn't automatically exit)  

## 4. Create a FAT32 filesystem

```bash
sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sdb1
sudo sync
```

Explanation:

- `mkfs.vfat` creates an MS-DOS FAT filesystem. Notice that we chose the first newly created partition `/dev/sdb1`, not the whole drive `/dev/sdb`.
- `sync` synchronizes cached writes to persistent storage
