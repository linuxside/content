Linux swap acts as an overflow area, when the system's physical memory is insufficient to handle the current workload, temporarily holding inactive pages of memory to free up valuable RAM for active processes.

Consequently, it allows the operating system to continue functioning smoothly, even when the physical memory is nearing capacity.

While **permanently removing swap space** might seem like a *bad idea*, there are Linux systems that could **benefit** from it.

One scenario where this can be useful is when the Linux operating system **runs from an SD card** that is susceptible to memory corruption, due to *limited write cycles*, and the running applications do not utilize the entire capacity of the RAM.

Another scenario in which removing swap is advantageous is when a product (that runs on Linux) transitions from development to production, and the specifications require **booting from read-only storage**.

**Temporarily removing swap space** can be used when someone decides to *resize the swap size* or transition from a swap file to a swap partition, or vice versa.

The two main swap types used in Linux systems are **swap files** and **swap partitions**. We will be covering both cases of removing swap from Ubuntu.

The operating system I chose to disable swap on is **Ubuntu**, but I believe this will work with any Linux distribution (at least with **Debian-derived distributions**).

## 1. List the active swaps

```bash
swapon --show
```

This command will display the type of swap present in your system, which will be utilized in the subsequent steps.

An example of output:

```text
NAME      TYPE       SIZE USED PRIO
/dev/sdb1 partition 14,9G 3,7M   -2
```

## 2. Disable swap for current session

If the swap is found on a partition, run:

```bash
sudo swapoff /dev/sdb1
```

If the swap is found within a file, run:

```bash
sudo swapoff /swapfile
```

Then

```bash
sudo rm /swapfile
```

After you run the command above, you must run the 3rd step or your system might fail to boot!

## 3. Remove swap at boot

The swap entry, which the Linux operating system utilizes at boot time, can be found in the `/etc/fstab` file.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```

Search for the line that has *swap* text in it and comment it out (or remove it completely).

**Example:**

```text
UUID=606c8e0e-f961-495b-98a4-1034ad079341 none swap    defaults        0 0
```

becomes

```text
# UUID=606c8e0e-f961-495b-98a4-1034ad079341 none swap    defaults        0 0
```
