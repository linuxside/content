Internet Protocol version 6 (**IPv6**) offers numerous advantages over **IPv4**, primarily addressing the issue of [IPv4 address exhaustion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4_address_exhaustion).

There are several reasons for **disabling IPv6**, ranging from **temporarily disabling it** for testing network connectivity to **permanently disabling it** when not in use, thereby reducing the attack surface on your system.

There are multiple ways to disable IPv6 on Linux, such as compiling the Linux kernel without support for IPv6, writing a one to the file `/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/disable_ipv6`, setting `ipv6.disable=1` on the kernel command line when booting from Grub, or creating an `/etc/sysctl.d/` configuration file. The method we are going to use today is the last one.

To execute the following commands, you must be using the **root account** or a **sudo-enabled user**.

The Linux OS I have selected for this demonstration is **Debian 11**, but these steps should work for **Debian-derived distributions** (such as **Ubuntu**) and, possibly, other Linux distributions as well (such as **Arch Linux**).

## 1. Temporarily disabling IPv6

```bash
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1
```

To re-enable IPv6 without reboot, run:

```bash
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=0
```

## 2. Permanently disabling IPv6

Create a configuration file

```bash
sudo nano /etc/sysctl.d/98-disable-ipv6.conf
```

Append at the end of the file the following

```text
# Disable IPv6
net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1
```

Save the changes and exit the text editor. In nano, press <kbd>Ctrl + X</kbd>, then <kbd>Y</kbd>, and finally, <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

Load the changes to sysctl (without a system reboot)

```bash
sudo systemctl restart systemd-sysctl.service
```

If you want to reverse the permanent disabling of IPv6 at a later time, simply delete the `/etc/sysctl.d/98-disable-ipv6.conf` file and restart the `systemd-sysctl.service`.

## 3. How to test if the IPv6 has been disabled

```bash
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/disable_ipv6
```

If the output is `1`, IPv6 has been successfully disabled.
