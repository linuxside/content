In a **MariaDB/MySQL** server, using the `root` user for an application can lead to **serious security implications**.  
If the application is vulnerable to an **SQL injection**, an attacker **gains access to all databases with all privileges**, allowing them to **view/create/modify/delete** both **databases** and **users**.  
As a result, using a root account to access a specific database is a **bad security practice** and should be avoided.

To address this issue, an application should be accessible with **a specific user** who has a limited set of permissions for **a single database**.  
For instance, if an application only needs to **read** a database, the associated user should have **read permissions** only for that database alone.  
This approach **minimizes the risks** in case something goes wrong, such as leaking database user/password credentials.

In this article, we will create a database, establish a user with restricted privileges, and assign the database with specific permissions to that user. This is called [the principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege).

**Note:** Make sure you change `new_mysql_database`, `new_mysql_user` and `new_mysql_password` with something of your own and [generate a strong password](https://www.expressvpn.com/password-generator).

## 1. Login to MariaDB/MySQL server

**Note:** This command must be run as **root** or as a **sudoer user**, hence the `sudo` in front of it.

```bash
sudo mysql -u root -p
```

and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd>

**Note:** you will first get asked the password of the system user running the command, NOT the password of MySQL root user. On the second password prompt just press <kbd>ENTER</kbd>.

## 2. Create the database

```sql
CREATE DATABASE `new_mysql_database`;
```

## 3. Create the user

```sql
CREATE USER 'new_mysql_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'new_mysql_password';
```

## 4. Grant all privileges to a specific database

```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON new_mysql_database.* TO 'new_mysql_user'@'localhost';
```

## 5. Grant all privileges to all databases (only if necessary)

```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'new_mysql_user'@'localhost';
```

## 6. Grant usage privileges to all databases (only if necessary)

```sql
GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'new_mysql_user'@'localhost';
```

## 7. Flush the privileges

```sql
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

## 8. Check the newly created user (optional)

```sql
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'new_mysql_user'@'localhost';
```

## Conclusion

By adhering to the principle of least privilege and creating a specific user with limited permissions for each application, we can significantly improve the security of our MariaDB/MySQL server.

This practice helps to mitigate the risks associated with SQL injection attacks and potential credential leaks, which could otherwise lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data and system resources.

By following the steps outlined in this article, you can create a separate user with the appropriate privileges, ensuring a safer and more secure environment for your database and applications.

Always remember to use strong and unique passwords for each user and avoid using the root account for application access.
