In a **MariaDB/MySQL** server, using the `root` user for an application can lead to **serious security implications**.  
If the application is vulnerable to an **SQL injection**, an attacker **gains access to all databases with all privileges**, allowing them to **view/create/modify/delete** both **databases** and **users**.  
As a result, using a root account to access a specific database is a **bad security practice** and should be avoided.

To address this issue, an application should be accessible with **a specific user** who has a limited set of permissions for **a single database**.  
For instance, if an application only needs to **read** a database, the associated user should have **read permissions** only for that database alone.  
This approach **minimizes the risks** in case something goes wrong, such as leaking database user/password credentials.

In this article, we will create a database, establish a user with restricted privileges, and assign the database with specific permissions to that user. This is called [the principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege).

**Note:** Make sure you change `new_mysql_database`, `new_mysql_user` and `new_mysql_password` with something of your own and [generate a strong password](https://www.expressvpn.com/password-generator).

## 1. Login to MariaDB/MySQL server

**Note:** This command must be run as **root** or as a **sudoer user**, hence the `sudo` in front of it.

```bash
sudo mysql -u root -p
```

and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd>

**Note:** you will first get asked the password of the system user running the command, NOT the password of MySQL root user. On the second password prompt just press <kbd>ENTER</kbd>.

## 2. Create the database

```sql
CREATE DATABASE `new_mysql_database`;
```

## 3. Create the user

```sql
CREATE USER 'new_mysql_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'new_mysql_password';
```

## 4. Grant privileges

To grant privileges to a specific database:

```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON new_mysql_database.* TO 'new_mysql_user'@'localhost';
```

To grant all privileges to all databases (only if necessary):

```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'new_mysql_user'@'localhost';
```

To grant usage privileges to all databases (only if necessary):

```sql
GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'new_mysql_user'@'localhost';
```

## 7. Flush the privileges

```sql
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

## 8. Check the newly created user (optional)

```sql
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'new_mysql_user'@'localhost';
```
