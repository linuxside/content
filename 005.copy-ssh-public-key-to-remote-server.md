Strengthening the security of your SSH server can be achieved by [generating an SSH keys](003.generate-ssh-public-private-key-pairs.md) and using it for authentication while disabling username/password authentication (also known as passwordless access).

When copying the key over to the remote server, it is important to note that only the **public key** should be copied. If this key is exposed, **it will not compromise your security**.

There are different methods available to copy your public key to the remote server, with varying levels of ease, the first one being the easiest.

It is important to ensure that the SSH server configuration is set to accept the authentication method via public/private key for a successful passwordless access.

While the steps outlined in this article are based on *Ubuntu*, they are likely applicable to *most Linux distributions*.

## 1. The ssh-copy-id method

The easiest way to copy the public key is to use the `ssh-copy-id` command.

```bash
ssh-copy-id <user>@<your-remote-host>
```

If you have **multiple keys** in the `~/.ssh` folder or the key is **located somewhere else**, you can specify the key location by running:

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub <user>@<your-remote-host>
```

For an SSH server that runs on a **different port**, use:

```bash
ssh-copy-id -p 22222 <user>@<your-remote-host>
```

## 2. Copy over SSH tunnel

If you do not have access to `ssh-copy-id` command, you can copy the key manually:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | ssh <user>@<your-remote-host> 'mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 0700 ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'
```

## 3. Copy/paste method

Connect to the remote server:

```bash
ssh <user>@<your-remote-host>
```

Create the `~/.ssh` directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
```

Change the permissions to allow only the current user to access it:

```bash
chmod 0700 ~/.ssh
```

Open the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file:

```bash
nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

and paste the public key that you copied in clipboard at the end of the file.
