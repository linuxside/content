In this guide I'm gonna be using an SSH sinkhole to trap the bots that are scanning port 22.  
The purpose of this is an experiment, to see the outcome of it after a few months of usage.  
Because the SSH server port must be moved to a different port, I do not recommend using this with the sole purpose of increasing the security. You cannot increase security through obscurity.

## 1. Install endlessh

Download it from its git repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/skeeto/endlessh.git
```

Compile it

```bash
cd endlessh
make
```

Install it

```bash
sudo make install
```

## 2. Configure endlessh

Create a config file

```bash
sudo mkdir /etc/endlessh
sudo nano /etc/endlessh/config
```

And paste

```text
# The port on which to listen for new SSH connections.
Port 22

# The endless banner is sent one line at a time. This is the delay
# in milliseconds between individual lines.
Delay 5000

# Set the detail level for the log.
#   0 = Quiet
#   1 = Standard, useful log messages
#   2 = Very noisy debugging information
LogLevel 1

# Set the family of the listening socket
#   0 = Use IPv4 Mapped IPv6 (Both v4 and v6, default)
#   4 = Use IPv4 only
#   6 = Use IPv6 only
BindFamily 4
```

## 3. Move OpenSSH server port

If you do not have OpenSSH server installed, you can skip this step.  
Because our new program will now be listening on port 22, the OpenSSH server port must be moved to a different port.

Edit the SSH server config file

```bash
sudo cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.original
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

And change the port from 22, to say 2222

```text
#Port 22
Port 2222
```

Restart the OpenSSH server

```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

## 4. Create a systemd service for endlessh

Create a user with limited permissions for the service to run under

```bash
sudo adduser --system --no-create-home --disabled-login --group endlessh
```

Create the service file

```bash
nano endlessh.service
```

And paste

```text
[Unit]
Description=Endlessh SSH Tarpit
Documentation=man:endlessh(1)
Requires=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=30sec
User=endlessh
Group=endlessh
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/endlessh
KillSignal=SIGTERM

# Stop trying to restart the service if it restarts too many times in a row
StartLimitInterval=5min
StartLimitBurst=4

#StandardOutput=journal
#StandardError=journal
StandardOutput=append:/var/log/endlessh.out
StandardError=append:/var/log/endlessh.err
StandardInput=null

PrivateTmp=true
PrivateDevices=true
ProtectSystem=full
ProtectHome=true
InaccessiblePaths=/run /var

## If you want Endlessh to bind on ports < 1024
## 1) run: 
##     setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /usr/local/bin/endlessh
## 2) uncomment following line
AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
## 3) comment following line
#PrivateUsers=true

NoNewPrivileges=true
ConfigurationDirectory=endlessh
ProtectKernelTunables=true
ProtectKernelModules=true
ProtectControlGroups=true
MemoryDenyWriteExecute=true

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Fix the service permissions, so that any user besides root cannot edit it

```bash
sudo chown root:root endlessh.service
```

Move the service file to the systemd config directory

```bash
sudo mv endlessh.service /etc/systemd/system/endlessh.service
```

Reload the config for the systemd

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Enable the service

```bash
sudo systemctl enable endlessh.service
```

Start the service

```bash
sudo systemctl start endlessh.service
```

## 5. Debug the service

To view the details of the newly created service

```bash
sudo systemctl status endlessh.service
```

or you can use

```bash
sudo journalctl -fu endlessh.service
```

If something went wrong during the startup process of the service, it might have hit the startup limit. To reset its limit, run

```bash
sudo systemctl reset-failed endlessh.service
```
