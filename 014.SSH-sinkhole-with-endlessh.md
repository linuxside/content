In this guide I'm gonna be using an SSH sinkhole to trap bots that are scanning port 22.  
The purpose of this is an experiment, to see the outcome of it after a few months of usage.  
Because the SSH server port must be moved to a different port, I do not recommend using this with the purpose of increasing the security. You cannot increase security through obscurity.

## 1. Install endlessh

Download the its git reposority:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/skeeto/endlessh.git
```

Compile it

```bash
cd endlessh
make
```

Install it

```bash
sudo make install

```bash
sudo mkdir /etc/endlessh
sudo nano /etc/endlessh/config
```

And paste

```text
# The port on which to listen for new SSH connections.
Port 22

# The endless banner is sent one line at a time. This is the delay
# in milliseconds between individual lines.
Delay 5000

# Set the detail level for the log.
#   0 = Quiet
#   1 = Standard, useful log messages
#   2 = Very noisy debugging information
LogLevel 1

# Set the family of the listening socket
#   0 = Use IPv4 Mapped IPv6 (Both v4 and v6, default)
#   4 = Use IPv4 only
#   6 = Use IPv6 only
BindFamily 4
```

## 3. Move OpenSSH server port
