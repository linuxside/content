## 1. Find the drive to partition:

```bash
sudo parted -l
```

My drive was `/dev/sdb`.

## 2. Partition the drive:

```bash
sudo parted /dev/sdb
````

a. type `mklabel gpt` to create a new partition table (as GPT)
b. type `unit TB` to set the reference unit as TB (optional)
c. type `mkpart` to create a new partition

Example of interactive questions:

```text
Partition name?  []? backup
File system type?  [ext2]? ext4
Start? 0
End? 100%
```

d. type **p** (print partition) to view the new partition
e. type **q** to exit the partition tool

## 3. Create a filesystem:

```bash
sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdb1
```

## 4. Modify the reserved root disk space:

In my case, the newly installed drive will be used as storage space and I want to use the entire available space.  
Usually, the drive has around 5% of reserved disk space for the root user if the drive was used to run the OS.  
This space ensures that the root user has access to the system even if the drive usage is 100%.

List the reserved root disk space:

```bash
sudo tune2fs -l /dev/sdb1
```

Set the reserved root disk space as zero:

```bash
sudo tune2fs -m 0 /dev/sdb1
```

## 5. Create a mounting point:

```bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/SSD-480GB
```

## 6. Find the UUID of the new drive:

```bash
sudo blkid
```

Output example:

> /dev/sda1: UUID="8009df1d-369b-495d-a763-0b6f8336d594" BLOCK_SIZE="4096" TYPE="ext4" PARTUUID="a7ef42c8-01"
> /dev/sdb1: UUID="2df90f6e-08c5-42d2-9459-929641c86d06" BLOCK_SIZE="4096" TYPE="ext4" PARTLABEL="backup" PARTUUID="a664d1bc-9e54-4188-a2ab-92d4d6dfac19"

## 7. Add the drive to fstab:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```

And add:

> # SSH 480GB
> UUID=2df90f6e-08c5-42d2-9459-929641c86d06 /mnt/SSD-480GB   ext4 noatime,nodiratime,errors=remount-ro 0 2

## 8. Mount the drive right away:

```bash
sudo mount -a
```

Check if mount was successful:

```bash
lsblk
```
