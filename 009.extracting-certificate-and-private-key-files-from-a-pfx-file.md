The `PKCS #12` (Public Key Cryptography Standard #12) is an archive file format for storing many cryptography objects, including a **private key** with its **X.509 certificate**.

The *Public-Key Cryptography Standards* are specifications produced by **RSA Laboratories** in cooperation with *secure systems developers worldwide* for the purpose of accelerating the deployment of public-key cryptograph. It was first published in 1991.

The filename extensions for the PKCS #12 are **.pfx** (Personal Information Exchange) or **.p12**.

The Linux distribution used was **Ubuntu 20.04** and the **OpenSSL** version was **1.1.1**, but this guide should work for newer Linux distributions or OpenSSL version.

## 1. Install OpenSSL

Extracting the *private key* and the *certificate* from PFX file will be done by using the **OpenSSL cryptographic utility**.  
The package is part of the *OpenSSL project*'s implementation of the *SSL and TLS cryptographic protocols* for secure communication over the Internet.

Before proceeding, ensure that the OpenSSL package is installed on your Linux distribution by executing the following command.

```bash
sudo apt install openssl
```

## 2. Extract the private key from PFX

```bash
openssl pkcs12 -in certificate.pfx -nocerts -out private-key.pem -noenc
```

For **OpenSSL version lower than 3.0**, use the following command instead.

```bash
openssl pkcs12 -in certificate.pfx -nocerts -out private-key.pem -nodes
```

Explanation:
- `certificate.pfx` is the filepath of your pfx file
- `private-key.pem` is the private key that is going to be extracted
- `-noenc` or `-nodes` option is used to disable the encryption of private keys that otherwise is enabled by default

## 3. Extract the certificate from PFX

```bash
openssl pkcs12 -in certificate.pfx -nokeys -out certificate.pem
```

Explanation:
- `certificate.pfx` is the filepath of your pfx file
- `certificate.pem` is the certificate that is going to be extracted
- `-nokeys` option is to disable the output of the private keys
