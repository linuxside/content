My **Linux** journey began in **2004** when a friend showed me a newly installed command line version of **Ubuntu 4**.

I was amazed by the size of the installation, the speed, and the apparent "**simplicity**". But mostly, I was impressed by the **CLI (command-line)** applications, such as `irssi` and `Teamspeak` server. At that time, the Linux world did not have many applications, and many of them required compilation under specific Linux distributions and dependencies. I remember searching through Ubuntu repositories and installing all the applications that seemed interesting.

Because I also wanted a **desktop environment** and Linux desktops had fewer (apparent) applications than **Windows**, while lacking basic knowledge about Linux, **it took me years** before I truly got into the Linux world.

Over the years, I tried many Linux distribution flavors, such as **Knoppix**, **Ubuntu**, **Debian**, **Arch**, **Manjaro**, and **Raspbian OS**, to name a few. There isn't one that I like the most. At this moment, I just know more about Debian-based Linux distributions, but I'm always ready to learn about new distros.

I created this blog to serve as a **notepad** where otherwise, all the notes about specific applications/installations/configurations are scattered throughout **many machines** that I've set up and **various portable drives**. It drives me nuts every time when I have to **search** for that specific task that I know I managed best a few weeks ago.

As a side note, this blog might be **beneficial** to others, as I previously had a blog hosted on **Blogpost.com** that got deleted by the **Google automated system** for an unknown reason. That blog had quite a few visitors over time.
