One of the most effective methods to **enhance security** on an **SSH server** is by utilizing **public-private key pair** for user authentication while disabling traditional username and password logins. This approach not only strengthens the security measures in place but also mitigates the risk of unauthorized access through brute force attacks and password compromises.

The `ssh-keygen` command is a crucial tool for generating, managing, and converting authentication keys for the SSH communication protocol. The key types supported by `ssh-keygen` are: **ED25519**, **ED25519-SK**, **ECDSA**, **ECDSA-SK**, **DSA** (deprecated), and **RSA** (you should generate the key with a minimum size of 2048 bits). This article will focus on the usage of the ED25519 key type, as there is documentation suggesting that [it is more secure than RSA](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/ssh.html#ed25519-ssh-keys).

Although our chosen operating system for this demonstration is **Debian**, the commands and processes outlined below are universally applicable to all **Debian-based** distributions, including but not limited to Ubuntu, Raspbian OS and Linux Mint.

## 1. Generate the key pair

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "Connect to X server from Y computer"
```

The `-C` option sets a comment that makes it easier to identify the public key among other public keys. If this option is not used, the `ssh-keygen` command will still add a comment in the format of `<user>@<hostname>` (which shows the user and the hostname used to generate the key pair).

When running the command, you will be prompted to enter the path for the new key pair. If you don't specify a custom path, the default path will be used, which generates two files (`id_ed25519` and `id_ed25519.pub`) in the `/home/user/.ssh` folder. Here, "user" refers to the current user's home folder.

At some point, you will be asked for a passphrase. It is highly recommended that you setup up one. You can skip this step, but consider the following scenario: if someone gains access to your computer and your keys, they will have access to every system that uses the key. Note that by setting up a passphrase, you will be prompted to enter it every time you use the SSH key pair.

**Note:** for those who still want to generate **RSA** keys, just change the `-t ed25519` part of the command with `-t rsa` and remember to generate the keys with a minimum key size of 2048 bits by adding `-b 2048`, if it is required by the version of ssh-keygen application that you have installed.

## 2. Copying the public key to the remote SSH server

The **.pub** file will be the **public key** that you'll have to copy over to the remote SSH server. This can be done securely via `ssh-copy-id` command, like this:

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i /home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub <user>@<your-remote-host>
```

Where `/home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` is the local path of the generated public key and the `<user>@<your-remote-host>` are the **user@hostname** of your remote SSH server.
