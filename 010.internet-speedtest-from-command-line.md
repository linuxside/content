The speedtest cli tool provided by **Ookla Speedtest platform** is a very easy and "*definitive way to test the speed and performance of your internet connection*" with **over 16k global servers**.

The only requirement is **Python**. At the moment of writing this note, both **Python 2** and **Python 3** are supported.

The OS I chose to do this under is **Ubuntu 21**, but it should work under any **Debian derived distribution**, such as Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Raspberry Pi OS, Arch Linux, etc.

## 1. Install Python

Python is the only requirement to use the `speedtest-cli` tool. In this guide, we are going to use Python 3, as it is the succesor of Python 2 is getting deprecated as of January 1, 2020.

```bash
sudo apt install python3
```

## 2. Installation of speedtest-cli

There are 2 options to install the `speedtest-cli` tool. One option is to install it from **GitHub repository** and another one is to use the **pip package installer** from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/).

I didn't mentioned the repositories method of installing as the third option, because the tool will be an old version (especially for Debian) that might not even work.

We are going to use the GitHub repository version, as it will always be newer than the one from pypi.org, as it's under active development.

Download the latest version from GitHub

```bash
wget -O speedtest-cli https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sivel/speedtest-cli/master/speedtest.py
```

Make the tool executable

```bash
chmod +x speedtest-cli
```

Copy the tool under a path available in the environment variable **$PATH**, so the **speedtest-cli** tool can be executed without writing its whole path or being in its folder.

```bash
sudo mv speedtest-cli /usr/local/bin/speedtest-cli
```

## 3. Checking the internet speed with speedtest-cli

a. simple **download/upload speed test** while showing the results in **bytes**

```bash
speedtest-cli --bytes
```

Sample output:

> Retrieving speedtest.net configuration...
> Testing from Proton AG (194.126.177.64)...
> Retrieving speedtest.net server list...
> Selecting best server based on ping...
> Hosted by HEIG-VD (Yverdon-Les-Bains) [543.81 km]: 1200022.766 ms
> Testing download speed................................................................................
> Download: 8.77 Mbyte/s
> Testing upload speed......................................................................................................
> Upload: 4.21 Mbyte/s

b. **download only** speed test

```bash
speedtest-cli --bytes --no-upload
```

c. **upload only** speed test

```bash
speedtest-cli --bytes --no-download
```

d. **list of the first 10 speedtest.net servers** sorted by distance

```bash
speedtest-cli --list
```

e. speed test with a **selected server**

```bash
speedtest-cli --bytes --server 12345
```

where **12345** is the ID offered by the **--list** option.

## 4. Update the speedtest-cli tool

If you followed this guide, the update is simply downloading the new version over the older one.

```bash
sudo wget -O /usr/local/bin/speedtest-cli https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sivel/speedtest-cli/master/speedtest.py
```
