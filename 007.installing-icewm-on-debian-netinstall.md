**IceWM** is a lightweight, highly configurable window manager designed for Unix-like operating systems, including Linux and BSD. It is renowned for its **efficient resource usage**, **minimalistic interface**, and **exceptional performance** on older hardware, making it ideal for users with **limited system resources**. IceWM closely resembles the classic Windows 95/98 interface, with a taskbar, system tray, and configurable menus.

IceWM is perfect for full-screen single-application mode (a.k.a kiosk mode) with the sole purpose of driving a single display to provide specific information, like a video or a webpage.

Before installing and setting up IceWM, ensure you have a **non-root user** who will launch IceWM. The root user **should be reserved for administrative tasks only**, and not utilized for everyday program execution.

The Linux distribution on which we are going to install IceWM is Debian 11, the [network install](https://www.debian.org/CD/netinst/) version.

## 1. Install IceWM

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install icewm xinit alsa-utils
```

**Note:** `alsa-utils` is optional, but without it, you will have no sound.

## 2. Autostart IceWM after non-root user login

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

and paste:

```bash
if [[ -z $DISPLAY ]] && [[ "$(tty)" = "/dev/tty1" ]]; then
  exec startx
fi
```

## 3. Reboot to see it in action

```bash
sudo systemctl reboot
```

**Note:** IceWM will only start after a successful login by the user for whom the startup script was written.
